
# Active Appearance Model C++ Library with Parallel Fitting implemented with OpenMP

This implementation was based on the Based on the AAM Library of GreatYao: https://github.com/greatyao/aamlibrary
and the parallel fitting algorithm was based the parallel algorithm designed in "Efficient parallel
Implementation of Active Appeareance Model Fitting Algorithm on GPU" by Wang, Ma, Zhu et Sun.

## Dependencies
- opencv 1.0 or later
- cmake 2.6 or later
- gcc 7.0
- openmp 4.5

## How to build your program

  > mkdir build

  > cd build

  > cmake ..

  > make

### Prepare:
- For model training, you should have several pairs of images and annotations. AAMLibrary supports pts and asf format.
- Download the imm dataset from AAM-API's homepage [link: IMM Dataset](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=922)
- Download helen dataset from this [link: Helen Dataset](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/)


### Training

- Train the Cootes's basic active appearance models using 16 layers
   > ./build train_images_path image_ext point_ext model_file


### Fitting

- Image alignment on an image
   > ./fit model_file image_file
